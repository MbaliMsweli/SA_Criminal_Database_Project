# SA_Criminal_Database_Project

# Project Overview

This project is based on a South Africa Criminal Database dataset where I was given 30 SQL questions to answer using structured query language (SQL).

The main objective of this project was to practice and demonstrate my ability to:

Write SQL queries

Perform data analysis using SQL

Use aggregate functions

Apply filtering and grouping

Extract meaningful insights from structured data

Think like a data analyst / data engineer

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains criminal case information including:

Case details

Crime type

Risk level

Province

Estimated fraud amount

Suspect age

Financial score

Arrest status

Investigating officer

Crime date

Previous offenses


# SQL Questions Covered

The project answers 30 SQL questions, including:

## Basic Queries

Display all records from the table

Count total number of cases

Filter cases by crime type

Retrieve suspects based on age

Display arrested suspects

## Aggregations & Analysis

Count cases per province

Count cases per crime type

Calculate average Financial Score

Find highest Estimated Fraud Amount

Calculate total fraud amount per province

Count cases per year

Identify the most common crime type

## Advanced Filtering & Insights

Retrieve top 10 highest fraud cases

Find suspects with more than 3 previous offenses

Identify youngest and oldest suspects

Determine province with highest number of cases

Analyze risk level distribution

Count cases handled per investigating officer

# Tools Used

Microsoft SQL Server

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

GitHub (for version control and documentation)

# Key SQL Concepts Practiced

In this project, I applied:

SELECT

WHERE

GROUP BY

ORDER BY

COUNT()

AVG()

SUM()

MAX()

MIN()

TOP

Conditional filtering

Date filtering (CrimeDate)

Aggregations per category

Sorting and ranking data

# Sample Insights Extracted

Through SQL queries, I was able to:

Identify which province has the highest crime cases

Determine total fraud amounts across provinces

Analyze arrest rates

Find high-risk fraud cases

Identify repeat offenders

Discover the most common crime type

 # What I Learned

From this project, I improved my ability to:

Translate business questions into SQL queries

Perform structured data analysis

Think analytically about crime and fraud data

Structure clean, readable SQL code

Document a technical project professionally

This project strengthened my foundation in SQL and data analysis, which is essential for data engineering and analytics roles.
